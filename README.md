## How to Run?

Simply launch index.html and then navigate to desired page.

## Where are the resources stored?

https://glitch.com/edit/#!/group-14-583-details?path=README.md%3A1%3A0

In the Assets folder. D3 would not pick up the csv file directly from your computer. So you can
just upload it to the glitch project and use that url to fetch it.
